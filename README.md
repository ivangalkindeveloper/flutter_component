# Flutter Component
ðŸ“± Ready-made component base using ready-made abstractions for quick use and decomposed by platform.

## Benefits
This package was created in order to reduce the boilerplate code of the presentation layer, to provide ready-made basic and custom components, which are also decomposed by platform.\
The package contains ready-made components, behaviors and approaches that will suit most applications.

## Design
Components follow the following design paradigm:
1) The component should not contain business logic;
2) All components must aspire to the behavior of the target platform;
3) If there is no such component in the target platform cookbook, a component is needed that will be as similar as possible to it and has identical behavior;
4) Component change the color of the disabled component, if it only has not background color;
5) Do not mix the design of cross-platform components and their behavior.

## Forks
The package uses a fork of the following packages:\
[animate_do](https://pub.dev/packages/animate_do) - fade animations.\
[animations](https://pub.dev/packages/animations) - transitional animations.\
[badges](https://pub.dev/packages/badges) - badges.\
[custom_rounded_rectangle_border](https://pub.dev/packages/custom_rounded_rectangle_border) - additional class for segment control component.\
[flutter_vibrate](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_vibrate) - all vibrations.\
[modal_bottom_sheet](https://pub.dev/packages/modal_bottom_sheet) - transitions that support modal animations and modal windows appearance method.\
[pinput](https://pub.dev/packages/pinput) - code fields and PIN fields.\
Express our gratitude to the authors of these dependencies.

## Usage
Initialize the main component widget at the root:
```dart
void main() => runApp(const MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return FlutterComponent( // Initialize the component widget
      platform: TargetPlatform.iOS,
      theme: MyLightTheme(), 
      size: MySizes(),
      textStyle: MyTextStyle(),
      haptic: MyHaptic(),
      child: MaterialApp(
          home: const HomeWidget(),
        );
    );
  }
}
```
Usage basic components:
```dart
FCBasicButton(
  backgroundColor: theme.primary,
  splashColor: theme.primaryLight,
  borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(24),
  child: Text("Next"),
  onPressed: _next,
),
```
Usage ready-made components:
```dart
FCPrimaryButton(
  title: "Next", 
  onPressed: _next,
),
```

## Main entites
### Config
A standard config widget that exposes all of the package's abstract dependencies.\

```
The method allows you to change the current platform:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changePlatform(platform: TargetPlatform.iOS);
```

final IFCSize size = config.size;
```
The method allows you to change the current sizes:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changeSize(size: FCDefaultSize());
```

### Text Style
An abstraction of a font weights and families that text components use.\
The default value is [FCDefaultTextStyle](https://github.com/ivangalkindeveloper/flutter_component/blob/master/lib/src/text_style/fc_default_text_style.dart).\

```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
final IFCTextStyle textStyle = config.textStyle;
```
The method allows you to change the current text styles:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changeTextStyle(textStyle: FCDefaultTextStyle());
```

### Haptic
An abstraction of vibration functions.\
The default value is [FCDefaultHaptic](https://github.com/ivangalkindeveloper/flutter_component/blob/master/lib/src/haptic/fc_default_haptic.dart).\
Get the actual vibration functions instance in the widget tree:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
final IFCHaptic haptic = config.haptic;
```
The method allows you to change the current haptic vibration:
```dart
final FCConfig config = FCConfig.of(context);
config.changeHaptic(haptic: FCDefaultHaptic());
```
